The function of this project is to inform all the people who will read it about the actual situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

Everything about the project, from the planing phases to the execution, you can find on the project's website, which when available will be displayed here: "ANALYSIS WEBSITE".

## Project Workflow

The project workflow start at:
* Data gathering 
* Data preprocessing
* Data analysis
* Data visualization
* Reporting

For now we wont write any tests because the website is not online yet, but eventualy will include full set of testing algorithms that will ensure that the website is functioning as expected.

Data gathering method and data preprocessing will be directed to a pipline where when the data is scraped automatically goes through the cleaning pipeline so we can use it.
