        <h1 class="header-h1-content">Planing the analysis</h1>
        <p>
            In this report will be analysing the COVID-19 pandemic in 
            Bosnia and Herzegivina. The purpose of this analysis is to see
            how well had the Bosnian government managed this situation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="header-h2-content">Type of reserach</h2>
        <p>
            This project will use Quantitative reserach because we are dealing
            with numerical data. Also as in other Quantitative research types
            will use hypothesis testing to prove our point on how well did
            the government managed the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data that we are using comes from two sources, and they are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#coronavirus-country-profiles">OurWorldinData</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.mcp.gov.ba/Publication/Category/projekti?category=7">Ministy of Civil Affairs</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We had to use those two sources because the data that the Ministy
            gathered was incomplete with the cases and missing values.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand the data gathered from the OurWorldinData website
            did not have any data about the tested, recovered and died people.
        </p>
        <p>
            By combining those two sources we managed to complete our dataset
            and now we can make the analysis. But beffore doing that will need
            to clean it and make it ready for the algorithms.
        </p>
        <h2 class="header-h2-content">Type of design and population definition</h2>
        <p>
            Descriptive and Correlational design will be our choice. The reason
            is simple we can track characteristics, trends and relationships 
            between our data variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our population will be the people who suffered from the pandemic.
        </p>
        <h2 class="header-h2-content">Data collection methods</h2>
        <p>
            As outlined in the type of research we'll be using those two sources,
            and it consists of scraping the data from the websites. So we can declare
            our data as a secondary data source (Because the data is gathered from 
            other institution and people).
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm that we are using is a special algorithm for scraping data,
            to create the algorithm we had to use a <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>
            package called <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>.                        
        </p>
        <p>
            This package allowed us to visit the website and scrape the HTML from it, now it was
            to us to create a propper algorithm to clean up the text data and store it in our
            data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm can be find in the module preporcessing.py in the class Preprocessing
        </p>
        <p>
            Because we are using the data from two source we need to defin the second algorithm that 
            scraping data from the second website <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#coronavirus-country-profiles">OurWorldinData</a>.
            This algorithm was much simpler because we did not need to parse the HTML, insted the data
            was stored in an excel file.
        </p>
        <p>
            To parse the data we just imported the file with <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and set what variables
            we want. At the end we combined the two data sources to form one full data source that can be
            worked with.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the dataset combined we need to clean it from the data that is not valid and missing data.
            For that we created a simple algorithm, that when the data is <strong>NaN</strong> we go back
            few days and extract the mean value and input it in the missing data cell.
        </p>
        <p>
            But we can not go and get the mean value for every varable the same. The <strong>New Cases</strong>
            variable we go back 5 days to extract the mean value the same is done for the 
            <strong>Tested</strong> and <strong>Recovered</strong> cases. But with the <strong>Died</strong> cases
            we go back 3 days back to get the mean value to fill the empty cell.
        </p>
        <p>
            And at the end we end up with a dataset like this. The data will be available through an API endpoint
            so everyone can use it.
        </p>

            <div class="table-responsive">

        <h2 class="header-h2-content">The hypothesis</h2>
        
        <p>The question we are asking in this analysis are:</p>
        <p class="special-text-box">
            How good was the COVID-19 pandemic managed in Bosnia and Herzegivina?
        </p>
        
        <p>The answer:</p>
        <p class="special-text-box">
            It was not managed good, from the start to today the pandemic has show us that the Bosnian government,
            currently constructed on all levels of the administration, has no answer to the current situation.
        </p>
        
        <p>My answer:</p>
        <p class="special-text-box">
            It's clear to all of us, that the government screw this opportunity, and to the naked eye we see the outcomes 
            off this situation, but the rabbit hole goes deeper and that the actual situation is even worse.
        </p>

        <p>Refining the hypothesis:</p>
        <p class="special-text-box">
            To us relevant variables for 
            this analysis are: new cases, tested people, deaths, recovered and vaccinations.
            That way we can analyze the government effort to manage this situation. But we expect 
            the results to outline the incapacity of the people who lead us.
        </p>

        <p>H<span style="font-size: 14px;">0</span> - the null hypothesis:</p>
        <p class="special-text-box">
            COVID - 19 pandemic prove that the government failed to manage this situation.
        </p>

        <p>H<span style="font-size: 14px;">1</span> - the alternative hypothesis:</p>
        <p class="special-text-box">
            The government did not fail to manage this situation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header-h2-content">The analysis strategy</h2>
        <p>
            The strategy of analysing the data is to use Descriptive statistics and after that use testing to prove our hypothesis. The testing will 
            be done on the whole data set but descriptive statistics can't be done on the whole data set, because we wont get the information we want.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get the most out of our data set will isolate every major period of the pandemic and apply descriptive statistics on it, that way
            we will get more accurate and deliver better information to our readers. The time stamps are:
