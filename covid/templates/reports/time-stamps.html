    To be more accurate by our analysis will create time stamps to analze the data. The period of analysis is devided into:
</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li><strong>March 5th, 2020. - July 1st, 2020.</strong></li>
        <p>
            The pandemic began in Bosnia and Herzegovina on March 5th 2020. with the first confirmed case in <a href="https://www.dw.com/sr/korona-virus-u-banjaluci-panike-za-sada-nema/a-52648923">Banja Luka</a>.
            As in the rest of the World, the government didn't take COVID serious. 13th of March 2020 the government announced the lockdown.
            And at the end of the period we got our <a href="https://www.dw.com/sr/afera-respiratori-po%C4%8Detak-obra%C4%8Duna-s-krupnim-kriminalom/a-53617210">afair respirators</a>.
        </p>
        <li><strong>July 1st, 2020. - October 10th, 2020.</strong></li>
        <p>
            In this period we got the summer season and B&H is a popular country for tourist's, the neighbour citizens at this time were most iterested
            for the sea, because Croatia had restrictions for Serbian citizens and the nearest countries with a sea were Montenegro and Bosnia.
            Due to overbooking in Montenegro and the restrictions for Bosnian citizens to go outside the country the town of Neum was a logical choice
            for all those who wanted to go to the sea.
        </p>
        <li><strong>October 10th, 2020. - January 10th, 2021.</strong></li>
        <p>
            School season started a month earlier and the virus spread in the school's and had a chain reaction as a consequence, but this was not the only
            reason of virus spreading. There were  no restrictions for the people like in the first phase. The Grocerie store were open, masks aren't required
            clubs were open and everything contirbuted to high number of infections.
        </p>
        <li><strong>January 10th, 2021. - May 30th, 2021.</strong></li>
        <p>
            As in the preavious section, here also we have problems with the same thing's we outlined above, but at this time in the world people begin to recive vaccines
            to protect themselves from the virus. In Bosnia we have the problem that there is no vaccines in the country because the government didn't buy them and the 
            reasons are simple politics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every vaccine that was delivered into the country was a donation and those people who didn't want to wait for the vaccines in Bosnia got them in Serbia.
        </p>
        <li><strong>May 30th, 2021. - August 31th, 2021</strong></li>
        <p>
            The low number of infections in this period can be to some degree explained to the vaccinations, people who got over the virus and the school end, but there
            are still tourists in the country, people travel more and there are no restrictions for the cafe's, club's and pub's. We can also see in the <a href="#chart-2">Chart - 2</a> 
            that in this period there were less tested people.
        </p>
        <li><strong>August 31th, 2021 - Today</strong></li>
        <p>
            At this time we see that the curve has an upward trend and that the numbers from few months are definitely suspicious. We expect the same to happen as in the same period of last year.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At this time we didn't talked about the testing, there is a real problem in this area. The testing process in some regions takes up to 7 days to get your result.
        That is because not all the hospitals have the testing equipment. At the begining of the pandemic the samples from the Hospital in Bihać needed to go to Sarajevo to be tested.
        This was done by transporting the samples with medical cars. That took a whole day to transport and test and the next day the results are sended to the hospital in Bihać.
        They improved the process by adding air transport and finally the Hospital got the testing equipment.
